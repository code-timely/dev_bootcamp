I have implemented task `Funny enough? ğŸ”«` ,  `List â€™em all! ğŸ’¯` , `Is it live? ğŸ”Œ`

I have utilised API Ninjas [random image api](https://api-ninjas.com/api/randomimage) for `Funny enough? ğŸ”«` & it [Riddles API](https://api-ninjas.com/api/riddles) for `List â€™em all! ğŸ’¯`

To implement 2 way connection I have leverage Binance's [websocket API](https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#websocket-market-streams) to display live prices of crypto currencies for `Is it live? ğŸ”Œ`
